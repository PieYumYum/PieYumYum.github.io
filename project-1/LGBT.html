        The LGBTQ community has been around for ages and throughout time we have seen different levels of acceptance of this group. Before going back, lets talk about what its like today, being widely accepted and even promoted in day to day media. More and more
        shows and movies and book are featuring queer identities, and some even focusing entirely on the subject. Now this could be in one of two ways of course, in the negative way, saying how its bad and that being a part of the queer community is a
        sin and how you are "going to hell" (the bible probably). But no actually, these days its seen as a positive thing, and theses characters and ideas are cherished by these pieces of media and most people are in agreement with this decision. Of
        course not everyone is ok with it, but that is just how people are. Now that we know how things are today, what about back in time a few years, such as in the 50's? Plato played by actor Sal Mineo Well, in our 1950's lit and film class, we watched
        a movie called Rebel Without a Cause and this movie actually had a lot of interesting side aspects of the LGBTQ community. The most interesting thing was the actor playing one of the main characters was actually gay, and the other male actor rumored
        to be bisexual (but never confirmed). This was huge for its time, as many studios wouldn't even case actors if they were gay. But even though the actors were gay, the characters they played had to be straight, as is every movie character during
        that time, but that doesn't mean that a little bit of their true identities slipped through. The platonic love the characters feel for each other feels a bit, romantic at times. But of course this wasn't allowed in consumer media in the 50's so
        everything between them is very much "in between the lines". This "hidden love" is a symbol of the 50's in a way, that the LGBTQ community existed and was alive, but media neglected to show it for fear of the public backlash and general dislike
        of it. But as I mentioned earlier, today its a great thing to show on TV, so what changed during these 50 odd years? Well whatever changed, Rebel Without a Cause was definitely a starting point.
