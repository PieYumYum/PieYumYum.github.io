    <h4>
        The ideas and concepts brought out in the film were very much in style with the 1950’s style of TV and movies at the time, but instead also focusing on more of an actual villain. The movies whole premise is all out there, an invasion of aliens designed
        to take over the world, and while this seems like a pretty normal 1950s thing, it did it in a unique way. Instead of the normal flying saucers and ray guns we are used to seeing in this time period, it features alternate methods of portraying
        otherworldly invaders, through doppelgangers. Now im sure everyone knows what a doppelganger is, its someone that looks, and normally acts very similar to someone. The aliens are dopplegangers of everyone, grown from pods somehow never explained.
        The main point of the movie was actually heavily influenced by the idea of communism, even thought the director stated that he never intended for it to be. The whole “they are going to take over the world, they feel no emotion and no love, who
        would want to be like that” vibe they put off is very strong and makes sense when thinking about the time period Now apart from the aliens, the movie also stays with its time period, featuring predominantly male cast, all white actors from what
        I can remember, and sticking with the women mainly being there to help the men. Now of course all these things don’t make the movie “bad”, in fact for having such a low budget the movie is quite amazing in my opinion. All of these things listen
        also appear in most 1950s television as well. For example, in class I watched the show, Father Knows Best and all these things ran true in there. The men seemed to take a lead in the show, normally being the center of everything while the women
        only seemed to exist to help/”please” the men. In IBS, the main women in the film, only was there to serve as a love interest to the main protagonists, and even got left behind in the end of the film. There are a lot of confusing things in the
        movie too, and going back to leaving the girl behind at the end, the aliens would be grown from pods and take the shape of people, then when the people are asleep, the new body copies them and “kills” the original person. HOWEVER, at the end of
        the movie, the girl falls asleep and BECOMES the alien, there is never any body switching at all. Things like this happened quite often in the movie, so its best not to think about all the fine details when watching movies from this time, just
        turn your brain off and enjoy them for what they are.
